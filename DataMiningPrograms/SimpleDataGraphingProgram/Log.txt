Log Notes:
--Not many issues experienced with generating the charts.
--We used anaconda and Spyder IDE with the libraries pre-installed, 
	which made things much easier.
--We were able to complete the last step, but the scripting felt 
	much poorer than the other steps, 
	as far as modularity and constructing useful functions.
--Finding the balance between making a modular program and a 
	quick script to graph the steps,
	was the most difficult part of the assignment.
--We also used barplots to try to convey histograms, because 
	it was far easier to work into the code.
	And we wanted to use our own custom frequencies/count format.

Assumptions:
--While writing the scripts we attempted to assumed that each 
	function should try to be written
	as a general case (for reuse)
