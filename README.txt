These folders contain python projects that were completed in both my Data Mining and Chaos Theory courses. 

The python programs are not documented very well, because function/specifications outweighed well-documented/modular python code unfortunately. 

Programs completed on weekly basis' so by no means represent long-term projects with developed plans.
